# Python Project 1

#1: CCTV in Seoul, Korea
Project Date: 
6/17/2018
Summary: 
This project uses Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze the current status quo of CCTVs/population in Seoul.    
This was based on a practice set in the book “파이썬으로 데이터 주무르기 [Analyzing Data with Python]” by 민형기. This particular practice can be found online.
My objective of this project was to: (1) Update all data from 2016 to 2017, (2) Reinterpret the findings based on the update, (3) Translate Korean to English. 
Key Facts: 
•	There are 25 districts in Seoul, Korea.
•	Statistics are all verified and pulled from government documents online (listed below). 
Key Findings: 
(1)	Top Three Districts with Most CCTVs: Gangnam-gu, Gwanak-gu, Guro-gu
(2)	Top Three Districts with Most Percentage of CCTVs Installed in the Past Three Years (2015-2017): Seocho-gu (+280%), Nowon-gu (+123%), Gangnam-gu (+94%)
(3)	Top Three Districts with Most Population: Songpa-gu, Gangseo-gu, Gangnam-gu
(4)	Top Three Districts with High Percentage of Foreigners: Yeongdeungpo-gu, Geumcheon-gu, Guro-gu
(5)	Top Three Districts with High Percentage of Senior Citizens: Gangbuk-gu, Jung-gu, Jongno-gu
(6)	Top Three Districts with High Percentage of CCTV/Population = Jongno-gu, Yongsan-gu, Jung-gu
Conclusion: 
There was a weak correlation (0.204) between the number of CCTVs and population in districts. Out of 25 districts, notable outliers were: 
•	Gangnam-gu: comparably most CCTVs installed.  
•	Songpa-gu: comparably least number of CCTVs installed despite being highly-populated. 
There was a negative weak correlation (-0.257) between the number of CCTVs and high percentage of senior citizens. Out of 25 districts, notable outliers were: 
•	Gangnam-gu: comparably most CCTVs installed.  
•	Songpa-gu: low percentage of senior citizens, low number of CCTVs
•	Gwanak-gu: comparably more CCTVs installed than other districts in relations to the percentage of senior citizens.
